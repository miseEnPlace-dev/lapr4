/**
 * A static initialiser to make sure there is the default bootstrapping data,
 * namely power user, when using the in memory repositories.
 * <p>
 * Since we are using an in memory implementation of the persistence, the
 * bootstrap data will be lost at the end of executing the bootstrap
 * application. This helper class initialises the same data as the bootstrapper
 * in the other applications.
 * <p>
 * Note that this is just for demo purposes and in a real scenario you would use
 * a persistent mechanism like a database or file system in order not to loose
 * data.
 * <p>
 *
 * Each repository must call this static initialiser, e.g.:
 *
 * <pre>
 * <code>
 * public class InMemoryMaterialRepository extends InMemoryDomainRepository<String, Material>
 *       implements MaterialRepository {
 *
 *    static {
 *      InMemoryInitializer.init();
 *    }
 * }
 * </code>
 * </pre>
