# Shared Board Protocol

- A TCP connection is established between the client and the server;
- The client sends a request to the server, with the server accepting incoming requests;
- Every request has a mandatory response format described in the communication protocol document;
- Once the connection is established, it is kept alive and is used for all required data exchanges while the clieent application is running.

## Communication Protocol Message Format

The communication protocol message format is described in the following table:

| Field        | Offset (bytes) | Length (bytes) | Description                                                                                                                                                                                   |
| ------------ | -------------- | -------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `VERSION`    | 0              | 1              | SBP message format version. This field is a single byte and should be interpreted as an unsigned integer (0 to 255). The present message format version number is one.                        |
| `CODE`       | 1              | 1              | This field identifies the type of request or response, it should be interpreted as an unsigned integer (0 to 255).                                                                            |
| `D_LENGTH_1` | 2              | 1              | These **two** fields `D_LENGTH_1` & `D_LENGTH_2` are used to specify the length in bytes of the `DATA` field. Both these fields are to be interpreted as unsigned integer numbers (0 to 255). |
| `D_LENGTH_2` | 3              | 1              | The length of the `DATA` field is to be calculated as: `D_LENGTH_1 + 256 x D_LENGTH_2`. The length of the `DATA` field may be zero, meaning it does not exist.                                |
| `DATA`       | 4              | -              | Contains data to meet the specific needs of the participating applications, the content depends on the message code.                                                                          |

## Communication Protocol Message Codes

## Authentication Request

Once the TCP connection between the Shared Board App application (client) and the Shared Board Server application (server) is established, the Shared Board App is forced to authenticate the local user by sending an `AUTH` request.

- Prior to successful `AUTH`, the server must ignore any request from the client with a code value above four and send back an `ERR` message as response.
- The user authentication is achieved by a username and password pair, both will be provided to the client application (Shared Board App) by the local user running it.
- The username and the password values are incorporated in the `AUTH` request at the `DATA` field as two null terminated strings of ASCII codes, first the username, followed by the password.
- The response to an `AUTH` request may be an `ACK`, meaning the authentication was successful, or an `ERR`, meaning it has failed. In the latter case, additional `AUTH` requests could be tried by the client.
