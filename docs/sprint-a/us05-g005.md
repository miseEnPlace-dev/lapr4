## Acceptance Criteria

- By configuration, the system must support that data persistence is done either "in memory" or in a relational database (RDB). Although in-memory database solutions can be used during development and testing, the solution must include a final deployment where a persistent relational database is used. The system should have the ability to initialize some default data.
