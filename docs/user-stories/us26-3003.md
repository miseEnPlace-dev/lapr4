# User Story 3003 - Synchronization Problems of Shared Boards

> As Project Manager, I want the team to "explore" the synchronization problems related to the syncronization of shared boards and design a conceptual solution based on practical evidence.

| Application | 4 - Shared Boards |
| Priority    | 1                 |

## Acceptance Criteria

- This functional part of the system has very specific technical requirements, particularly some concerns about synchronization problems.
- In fact, several clients will try to concurrently update boards.
- As such, to explore and study this concurrency scenario a "model" of a solution must be implemented and evaluated in C, using processes and semaphores.
- Specific requirements will be provided in SCOMP.

## Requirements

- **NFR11** Explore Shared Board Synchronization - This functional part of the system has very specific technical requirements, particularly some concerns about synchronization problems. In fact, several clients will try to concurrently update boards. As such, to explore and study this concurrency scenario a "model" of a solution must be implemented and evaluated exceptionally using the C programming language, and using processes and semaphores. Specific requirements will be provided in SCOMP.
