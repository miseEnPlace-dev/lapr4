# Team Rules

In order to keep things consistent over the development of the project these are the rules every member should follow:

- For every feature/US a new branch must be created.
- For almost every feature/US a Pull Request must be made & reviewed.
- In the end of each sprint create a new release on github named `sprint-X`.
- Foreach task an issue must be created.

> üí° Note: Some actions don't require a branch, like updating the README.md file.

## Conventions

### Commits

purpose(specification[optional]): descriptive message (#issue-number[optional])

> üí° Note: You may want to link the issue number in the commit message. Example: `feat: added vaccine scheduling system (#123)`.

> üí° Note: If the commit closes an issue you can use the keyword `closes` or `fixes` followed by the issue number. Example: `fix(meetings): fixed meeting creation bug (closes #15)`

#### Example

- feat: added vaccine scheduling system
- docs(readme): added new us07 specifications
- feat(ui): added new button to patient screen (#15)
- fix(meetings): fixed meeting creation bug (closes #15)

### Branches

purpose/objective

> üí° Note: When naming branches use dash case.

branch-name ‚úîÔ∏è
branchName ‚úñÔ∏è

#### Example

- feat/scheduling-system
- fix/bug-123

### Issues

The issues can be named in a more informal way but it must be clear what the issue is about.

#### Example

- Add vaccine scheduling system
- Fix bug on meeting creation

### Pull Requests

The pull request must have a title and a description. The title must follow the same convention as the commits. The description must have a link to the issue that is being solved.

#### Example

- Title: Feature/added vaccine scheduling system
- Description: This PR adds the vaccine scheduling system. Closes #123

## Example of purposes

- feat: a new feature is being added
- fix: something broken is being fixed
- docs: documentation changes
- refactor: changes to the code organization
- test: new tests were added/changed
- chore: minor code changes that does not impact functionality (Ex. removing/adding blank lines)

## Pull Requests

To ensure code quality and that all team members are in sync every feature/US that is relevant must have a Pull Request that must be reviewed by the team. Only after the approval from the development team the branch can be merged to the main branch.

## Useful commands

`git add -p` - It helps to separate large code changes in small commits. A iterative menu is presented to select what code pieces you want to add to a given commit.

`git diff` - Shows the difference between the current state and the last commit

`git branch -b branch-name` - Creates a branch named branch-name

`git status` - Lists all changed files

`git branch -a` - Lists all branches in the repository

`git checkout branch-name` - Change from current branch to branch-name

`git diff branch1..branch2` - Compare two branches

## Definition of Done (DoD)

- The code is reviewed by at least one team member
- The code is merged to the dev branch
- The code is deployed to the staging environment
- The code is tested in the staging environment
