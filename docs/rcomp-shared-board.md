# RCOMP - Shared Board

## Shared Board Protocol

- A TCP connection is established between the client and the server;
- The client sends a request to the server, with the server accepting incoming requests;
- Every request has a mandatory response format described in the communication protocol document;
- Once the connection is established, it is kept alive and is used for all required data exchanges while the client application is running.

### Communication Protocol Message Format

The communication protocol message format is described in the following table:

| Field        | Offset (bytes) | Length (bytes) | Description                                                                                                                                                                                   |
| ------------ | -------------- | -------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `VERSION`    | 0              | 1              | SBP message format version. This field is a single byte and should be interpreted as an unsigned integer (0 to 255). The present message format version number is one.                        |
| `CODE`       | 1              | 1              | This field identifies the type of request or response, it should be interpreted as an unsigned integer (0 to 255).                                                                            |
| `D_LENGTH_1` | 2              | 1              | These **two** fields `D_LENGTH_1` & `D_LENGTH_2` are used to specify the length in bytes of the `DATA` field. Both these fields are to be interpreted as unsigned integer numbers (0 to 255). |
| `D_LENGTH_2` | 3              | 1              | The length of the `DATA` field is to be calculated as: `D_LENGTH_1 + 256 x D_LENGTH_2`. The length of the `DATA` field may be zero, meaning it does not exist.                                |
| `DATA`       | 4              | -              | Contains data to meet the specific needs of the participating applications, the content depends on the message code.                                                                          |

### Communication Protocol Message Codes

The communication protocol message codes are described in the following table:

| Code | Description            | Meaning                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                |

### Authentication Request

Once the TCP connection between the Shared Board App application (client) and the Shared Board Server application (server) is established, the Shared Board App is forced to authenticate the local user by sending an `AUTH` request.

- Prior to successful `AUTH`, the server must ignore any request from the client with a code value above four and send back an `ERR` message as response.
- The user authentication is achieved by a username and password pair, both will be provided to the client application (Shared Board App) by the local user running it.
- The username and the password values are incorporated in the `AUTH` request at the `DATA` field as two null terminated strings of ASCII codes, first the username, followed by the password.
- The response to an `AUTH` request may be an `ACK`, meaning the authentication was successful, or an `ERR`, meaning it has failed. In the latter case, additional `AUTH` requests could be tried by the client.

## HTTP Server

The Shared Board App also implements an HTTP server to render a view only page of a board.
The browser receives static files from the server and can also send AJAX requests to certain endpoints in order to retrieve data from the server.

<!-- TODO -->

Inspired by famous frameworks, a Router was implemented to handle each HTTP request and make it easier to develop

## SSL

The Shared Board also implements SSL to encrypt the communication between the Shared Board App and the Shared Board Backend, as well as to encrypt the communication between the HTTP server and the browser by using HTTPS.

## Cloud Deployment

<!-- TODO -->

ISEP provides to its students a cloud platform where students can deploy Virtual Servers using pre-made templates.
We deployed the Shared Board Backend & the database on this platform.

Go to the [ISEP's DEI Virtual Servers Private Cloud](https://vs-ctl.dei.isep.ipp.pt/)

To use the deployment, read the [Deployment Guide](../README.md#6-deploy-to-a-remote-machine) section in the main README.
